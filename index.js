// //Key Differences Between for...of and for...in
// for...of is used to iterate over values in an iterable object (like arrays or strings), while for...in is used to iterate over the keys (properties) of an object.

// for...in should not be used to iterate over arrays, as it doesn't guarantee the order of iteration and is generally slower.

// for...of is cleaner and more semantically correct when you need to deal with elements of an array or string, while for...in is ideal for enumerating object properties.

// When to Use Each Loop
// Use for...of when iterating over arrays, strings, or other iterable objects.

// Use for...in when you need to enumerate the properties of an object.
